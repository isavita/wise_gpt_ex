# WiseGPTEx

WiseGPTEx is an Elixir library that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model and Anthropic's Claude model to provide intelligent question answering, reasoning capabilities, and AI-generated text completions.

## Installation

1. Add `wise_gpt_ex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:
```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:wise_gpt_ex, "~> 0.5.0"}
  ]
end
```

2. Add the OpenAI and Anthropic API keys to your configuration file (e.g., config/config.exs):
```elixir
config :wise_gpt_ex, :openai_api_key, "your_openai_api_key"
config :wise_gpt_ex, :anthropic_api_key, "your_anthropic_api_key"
```

## Usage (OpenAI API)

To use WiseGPTEx, simply call the `get_best_completion/2` or `get_best_completion_with_resolver/2` function with a question and optional list of options:
```elixir
{:ok, response} = WiseGPTEx.get_best_completion("What is the capital of France?")
```

You can also pass options to customize the API request:
```elixir
opts = [model: "gpt-4", temperature: 0.4, num_completions: 4, timeout: 3_600_000]
{:ok, response} = WiseGPTEx.get_best_completion_with_resolver("What is the capital of France?", opts)
```

You can also make a raw call to the OpenAI API using the `get_raw_completion/2` function:
```elixir
messages = [
  %{"role" => "system", "content" => "You are High School Geography Teacher"},
  %{"role" => "user", "content" => "What was the capital of France in 15th century?"}
]
{ok, response} = WiseGPTEx.get_raw_completion(messages, [model: "gpt-4", temperature: 0.75, timeout: 3_600])
```

Note that the `get_best_completion_with_resolver/2` function is similar to `get_best_completion/2`.
This is because the difference between these two functions is in the method of how they select the best completion, not in their usage or the nature of their inputs or outputs.
The `get_best_completion_with_resolver/2` function will perform an additional API call to get a more accurate completion, which can be beneficial for complex or ambiguous queries.
The `get_raw_completion/2` function allows sending a custom conversation to the API without any additional prompting or setting the up the system role etc. This is useful when you want direct access to the model's system messages.

## Anthropic API
For interactions with the Anthropic API, use the get_anthropic_completion/2 function:
{:ok, response} = WiseGPTEx.get_anthropic_completion("Why is the sky blue?")

## Options

### Options for the OpenAI API functions:

- `:model` - The name of the OpenAI model to use (default: "gpt-3.5-turbo").
- `:temperature` - Controls the randomness of the model's output. Higher values result in more diverse responses (default: 0.5).
- `:num_completions` - The number of completions to generate (default: 3).
- `:timeout` - The maximum time in milliseconds to wait for a response from the OpenAI API (default: 3_600_000 ms, or 60 minutes).

### Options for the Anthropic API function:

- `:model` - The version of the Claude model to use (default: "claude-2").
- `:temperature` - Controls the randomness of the model's output (default: 0.1).
- `:max_tokens_to_sample` - Maximum number of tokens to generate (default: 100,000).
- `:timeout` - Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for a response (default: 3,600,000 ms, or 60 minutes).
